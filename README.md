The 'boids' package is a simple package that allows one to model the aggregate motion of a simulated flock of 'boids' (or birds) using a behavioural model. 

To install boids run ‘python setup.py install’ in the command line, in the folder in which you have the package downloaded. Alternatively, the package can also be pip installed. To run the animation use the command ‘animate_boids’ in the command line. 

A configuration file is included with the package which contains the input parameters of the model. The parameters of the model can be updated by editing the configuration file.
